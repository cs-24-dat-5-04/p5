The test T gives a positive result for a rare genetic mutation M linked to Alzheimer’s disease. The mutation is present in only 1 in a million people. The test is 99.99% accurate, i.e. it will give a wrong result in 1 out of 10000 tests performed. Should the person be worried, i.e., what is the probability that the person has the mutation given that the test showed a positive result? Hint: This is partly a modeling exercise and partly a calculation exercise. First, you need to formalize the problem:\n• What are the relevant variables and what states do they have?\n• Based on the description above, what probability distributions can you infer for the variables?\nBased on this formalization, you need to find the rules required to answer the question about the probability of a mutation given a positive test result."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Solution: We analyze the problem using the two random variables Test ∈ {positive, negative} and Mutation ∈ {present, absent}. What our patient should be interested in is the probability of having the mutation, given everything he/she knows, i.e., the fact that there was a positive test result. Thus, we need to compute P(Mutation = present | Test = positive).\n\nAccording to Bayes' rule, this is equal to:\nP(Test = positive | Mutation = present) * P(Mutation = present) / P(Test = positive)\n\nOf the probabilities on the right, we have:\n- P(Test = positive | Mutation = present) = 0.9999\n- P(Mutation = present) = 0.000001\n\nWe still need P(Test = positive). This can be computed as:\n\nP(Test = positive) = P(Test = positive, Mutation = present) + P(Test = positive, Mutation = absent)\n\nThis is equal to:\n\nP(Test = positive | Mutation = present) * P(Mutation = present) + P(Test = positive | Mutation = absent) * P(Mutation = absent)\n\n= 0.9999 * 0.000001 + 0.0001 * 0.999999 ∼ 0.0001\n\nWe now get:\n\nP(Mutation = present | Test = positive) = 0.9999 * 0.000001 / 0.0001 = 0.009999.\n\nThus, there is only about a 1% chance that the patient has the mutation."}]}
